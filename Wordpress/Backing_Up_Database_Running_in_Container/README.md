<p><strong>Problem</strong><br />You are using a MySQL image to provide a database service. You need to back up this database for data persistency.</p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong><br />Several backup strategies are possible alone or in combination. The two main concepts with containers are that you can execute a command inside a container running in the background and that you can also mount a host volume (i.e., a single accessible storage area in your host filesystem) into the container. In this recipe, you will see how to do the following:</p>
<p>&bull; Mount a volume from the Docker host into the MySQL container<br />&bull; Use the docker exec command to call mysqldump</p>
<p>A way to keep the data, even when containers are removed with the docker rm -v command, is to mount a volume from your Docker host inside a container. If you were to delete the MySQL container with only the docker rm command, the volume defined by the image would still persist even if you delete the container. If you look at the Dockerfile used to build the MySQL image, you sill see a reference to VOLUME /var/lib/mysql . This means that when you start a container based on this image, you can bind mount a host directory to this mount point inside the container.<br />Let&rsquo;s do it:</p>
<p><strong>$ docker run --name mysqlwp -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=wordpressdocker -e MYSQL_DATABASE=wordpress -e MYSQL_USER=wordpress -e MYSQL_PASSWORD=wordpresspwd -v /home/docker/mysql:/var/lib/mysql -d mysql</strong></p>
